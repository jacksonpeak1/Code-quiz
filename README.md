## Description
This was the most difficult challenge as of yet. This assignment required a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding to get the quiz functioning perfectly. In HTML we built the skeleton of the quiz by including the text on the opening screen, and a variety of button creations, while among other things. Furthermore, in CSS we created the the styling for the text and buttons on the home screen, while also including the styling for the answer choices throughout the various questions. Finally in JavaScript we used a variety of methods and functions for a creating the timer  using setInterval, and and creating the workings behind selecting the right answer choices, navigating through the pages, and putting the functioning behind each button. Overall I really enjoyed this project, and it made me excited for the future for what is to come.
